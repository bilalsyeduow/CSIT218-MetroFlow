The application demonstrates classical pathfinding algorithms (A* and Dijkstra)
through a grid-based simulation and a real-world routing example.

## Objectives
- Understand heuristic vs non-heuristic search
- Compare A* and Dijkstra performance
- Visualize shortest-path routing

## Features
- Grid-based simulation using Pygame
- A* vs Dijkstra path comparison
- Dynamic obstacle and cost handling
- Real-world map routing example

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pygame
- A* Search Algorithm
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
